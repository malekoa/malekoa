This blog is for keeping track of stuff I'm building/learning to build.

I started this blog in my spare time when I was interning at Amazon in Summer 2024 in Vancouver.

I'm finishing up my computer science degree at Concordia University in Montreal, and I'm also doing a minor in linguistics.
I'm interested in getting really good at building software using Go, so most of the stuff I write about will be related to that.
