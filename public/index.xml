      <description>This post documents the process of developing an event queue service in Go. To see the full code, check out the Github repository&#xA;Introduction When working with microservices, it&amp;rsquo;s important to keep your services decoupled. This makes it easier to change one component without affecting the others. But your services still need to communicate with each other. One way to do this is to have components send messages directly to each other.</description>

      <description>This blog is for keeping track of stuff I&amp;rsquo;m building/learning to build.&#xA;I started this blog in my spare time when I was interning at Amazon in Summer 2024 in Vancouver.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m finishing up my computer science degree at Concordia University in Montreal, and I&amp;rsquo;m also doing a minor in linguistics. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in getting really good at building software using Go, so most of the stuff I write about will be related to that.</description>
